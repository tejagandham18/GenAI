What is a Neural Network ?

At the beginning, the neural network knows nothing.
When we give it data, the first thing it does is accept inputs — these inputs can be numbers like age, salary, study hours, or even pixels of an image.
Each input is not treated equally.
The network assigns an importance value, called a weight, to every input. Important inputs get higher weights, less important ones get lower weights.
Next, inside the network, all these inputs and their weights are combined and processed.
This processing happens in the hidden layers, where the network tries to understand patterns in the data.
After processing, the network reaches a decision point.
Here, an activation function decides whether the signal should be strong or weak — just like a human deciding “Yes, this looks correct” or “No, this doesn’t.”
Finally, the network produces an output, which can be a prediction, a classification, or a probability.
If the output is wrong, the network does not stop.
It compares its answer with the correct one, calculates the error, and sends that error backward through the network. During this step, it adjusts the weights so that it performs better next time.
This process repeats again and again with more data, and over time, the neural network learns from its mistakes and becomes more accurate.
That is how a neural network works — by learning patterns through repeated experience and correction.


What is Deep Learning ?

It starts with the same foundation as a normal neural network, but instead of having just one or two hidden layers, deep learning uses dozens or even hundreds of hidden layers. That depth allows the model to learn multiple levels of abstraction.
In traditional machine learning, we usually had to manually engineer features. For example, for an image we had to extract edges, textures, and shapes before feeding them to a model. Deep learning removes that manual process by letting the neural network learn these features automatically during training.
The way it works is like a hierarchy. The data first enters the network through the input layer. As it passes through each hidden layer, the representation of the data becomes more meaningful.
For example, if we are training on image data:
The first layers learn very basic features like edges and lines.
The middle layers begin to identify meaningful parts, like ears or eyes.
The deepest layers understand full objects and concepts, such as “this looks like a cat.”
Once the network has produced an output, it compares its prediction with the correct answer and calculates an error. This error is then pushed backward through the network in a process called backpropagation, allowing the model to adjust its internal weights so that the next prediction is more accurate.
This cycle of prediction → error calculation → weight adjustment is repeated over many examples. With time, the network becomes highly accurate without needing explicit human-designed rules or features.
What makes deep learning particularly powerful is that it can learn directly from raw, unstructured data like images, audio, and text, and it continues to improve as more data and computational power are provided.So in simple terms, deep learning is the extension of neural networks to many layers, enabling the system to automatically extract and learn complex patterns from data through repeated experience and correction
